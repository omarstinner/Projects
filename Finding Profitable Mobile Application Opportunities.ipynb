    "## Introduction\n",
    "> The modern world is centered around working with technology, and more specifically with mobile applications. The majority of tasks we complete today are through applications, from browsing social media to checking the balances of our bank accounts. For this reason, mobile applications have become an attractive entity for monetization. Applications that generate large amounts of traffic can be very profitable through selling advertising space on their platforms. The aim of this project is to help recommend profitable mobile app profiles to a mobile app developer client. Our client is interested in strictly making free apps and revenue through such apps are heavily influenced by the number of users that you use the app. That being said, the goal of this project is to figure out which types of apps are likely to attract more users. Throughout this project, we will be extracting our insights from the following two datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - appstore.csv - A data set containing data about approximately seven thousand iOS apps from the App Store.\n",
    "> - playstore.csv - A data set containing data about approximately ten thousand Android apps from Google Play.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The first part of this notebook will focus on preparing and cleaning the dataset for analysis, while the second part will center on analyzing the cleaned data and synthesizing a recommendation."

    "> Looking at the table above, we can see that the \"Navigation\" category is dominated by well-established applications such as \"Waze\" and \"Google Maps\". This Category might seem popular, because of its high number of average installs (~86090), however, this is not the case as the category average is highly influenced and skewed by install counts of these applications. This is evident through the skewness score of 1.66 and the percent decrease in average installs of ~ 95% after removing these \"big\" apps. The category only has 6 applications where most of the installs are coming from two well-established applications, making penetrating this market difficult and not feasible. Let us explore the second most popular genre: \"Reference\"."

    "> We see the same pattern in the \"Reference\" genre as we did in the \"Navigation\" genre - well-established apps are dominating the category in terms of \"Installs\" (\"Bible\", \"Dictionary.com\"). However, in the \"Reference\" genre, for the \"Installs\" column we have a much lower skewness Score of ~0.88. Although this is still a relatively high skewness score, it is much lower than that of the \"Navigation\" genre and indicates that its \"Installs\" count is influenced by more than just a couple of applications. Also, the average percent decrease in the number of installs has improved relative to the \"Navigation\" genre (95% vs 86%) making developing a \"Reference\" application a viable option. The category has many more applications than that of the \"Navigation\" category further indicating greater potential in this genre. Coupled with the fact that the genre in itself is popular, the \"Reference\" genre seems to be a feasible and practical option for new mobile development."

    "> The most popular category in the app store is \"COMMUNICATION\". However, after further inspection, we see that the mobile applications we would be competing with are: \"Gmail\", \"Google Chrome\", \"Hangouts\", \"Messenger\", \"Skype\", and \"WhatsApp\" etc. As we can see we have 27 apps skewing the average for all 287 applications in this Category. This shows us that these applications hold the biggest market share in the \"COMMUNICATION\" mobile app industry and it wouldn't make sense to try and penetrate such a market with already established players. After removing them we can see that the average installs for the \"COMMUNICATION\" category fell 90%. This indicates that the majority of the \"Install\" averages were made up of the above-listed applications. Also, the skewness Score of ~0.72 makes the \"COMMUNICATION\" category not a feasible option for profitable mobile development. Let us explore the second most popular category: \"VIDEO_PLAYERS\"."

After removing such \"big\" applications and recalculating the average for the \"VIDEO_PLAYER\" category, the average fell by 77%, indicating how strong of a position \"Dubsmash\" and \"Google Play Movies\" have in the \"VIDEO_PLAYER\" mobile app market. However, we see an improvement in skewness score of ~0.59, indicating that there are more applications that are influencing the \"Installs\" average relative to the \"COMMUNICATION\" category. Although we see an improvement, we also need to pick a genre that is mutually available in the Apple App Store. For that reason coupled with the fact that there are still a small number of apps controlling the average \"Install\" count, we will have to pick another category. Since the \"Reference\" genre in the Apple App Store was a viable option, let us explore a similar category in the Google Play Store, the \"BOOK_AND_REFERENCES\" category."

    "> We still see the same trend of a couple of applications influencing the average installs. This is evident when we calculate the percent decrease in average installs (-83%) after removing the above \"BOOKS_AND_REFERENCES\" applications. However, the \"REFERENCE_AND_BOOKS\" category does have a significantly lower skewness score of ~0.35, making it a more attractive genre to develop a profitable mobile application. The genre only has one application (\"Google Play Books\") that has 1,000,000,000 installs (unlike the \"COMMUNICATION\" and \"VIDEO_PLAYER\" categories), This shows that there is only a handful of very popular applications in this category, leaving us with an opportunity to create an app. Developing a profitable app in this genre is a feasible option as there are opportunities in both stores, the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. Now that we have settled on a genre, let’s specifically pick a type of application to develop. Let us take look at the apps in these categories in both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store."
